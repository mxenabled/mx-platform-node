### SDK-Generation-Publishing-Flow.md
⚠️ **LEGACY** - Describes the single-version SDK system before multi-version support was added (pre-January 2026).

**Do not use this as a reference for current workflows.** For current documentation, see:
- [Multi-Version-SDK-Flow.md](../Multi-Version-SDK-Flow.md) - Current system overview
- [Workflow-and-Configuration-Reference.md](../Workflow-and-Configuration-Reference.md) - Current technical details
- [Adding-a-New-API-Version.md](../Adding-a-New-API-Version.md) - How to add new API versions

This document is kept for **historical reference only** and may be useful for repositories that have not yet migrated to multi-version support.
